In PatternFly, layouts are the containers that allow for organizing and grouping elements.

Layouts should be used (where possible) instead of writing custom CSS. Layouts allow components to remain modular, as the layouts handle the styles necessary to position components in different contexts. Layout styles should never be part of a component.

This module will cover seven of PatternFly's layouts: 
* bullseye
* flex
* gallery
* grid
* level
* split
* stack
