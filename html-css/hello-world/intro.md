Module 4: Patternfly Layouts

In Patternfly, layouts are the containers that allow for organizing and grouping elements.

You should use layouts instead of writing custom CSS, as layouts allow components to remain modular. The layouts handle the styles necessary to position components in different contexts and these styles must remain separate from the component.

We will go over our 7 different layouts: bullseye, flex, gallery, grid, level, split and stack.
